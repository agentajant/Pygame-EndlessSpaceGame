# Pygame-EndlessSpaceGame
Made an endless game in class 8th using pygame, for Pygame Summer Game Jam 2021
# 🎮 Abby and the Time trap — A Pygame Project

[**Abby and the Time Trap on itch.io**]([https://fpsbyaj.itch.io/abby-and-the-time-trap])


This is a simple endless game made using **Python** and **Pygame** library, developed when I was just 11 years old (Class 7)!  
It features a spaceship dodging astroids as their speed keeps increasing.

-after the deadline for jam ended, I used unity to create a .apk(andriod) version for this too (on the itch page).
